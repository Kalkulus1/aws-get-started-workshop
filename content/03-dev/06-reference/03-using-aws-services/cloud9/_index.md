This document highlights special considerations when using the [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) IDE in your team development AWS accounts.

## Why Use AWS Cloud9?
If you have challenges getting the AWS CLI and other tools installed on your corporate desktop, you may find it useful to use AWS Cloud9, a web-based IDE that enables you to deploy a development environment in your AWS account.  

Each Cloud9 environment is an Amazon EC2 Linux instance that includes a browser-based IDE. You deploy a Cloud9 environment in one of your public subnets and access it via the Cloud9 service.

The original offering of Cloud9 deployed the backing EC2 instances to public subnets.  This enabled users to directly access the Cloud9 IDE from the internet, which meant assignment of a public IPv4 address.  

However, many organizations desire (or require) their development VPCs to be restricted from the public internet.  A recent update to Cloud9 enables the instances to be launched in private subnets.  In this architecture, the developers will use AWS Systems Manager to proxy access to the instances.  The Cloud9 documentation refers to instances in private subnets as ["no-ingress EC2 instances" and they require additional configuration.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/ec2-ssm.html)
