# Get Started with AWS for Production Workloads

This guided workshop is intended to help you move from the stage of experimenting with AWS to deploying your first few proof of value workloads to production in AWS. The guide focuses on helping you establish an initial foundation on AWS that is suitable for workloads of many types. Later, based on the success of your initial proof of value workloads, you will likely expand your foundation in AWS to align with your expanded use of AWS.
