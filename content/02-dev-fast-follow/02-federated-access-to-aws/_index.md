This section addresses how you can establish federated access to your AWS environment so that users who need direct access to the AWS platform via the AWS Management Console, AWS service APIs, and/or AWS CLI can use their standard corporate identities. 

These approaches reuse your existing corporate identity source instead of depending on management of users and groups locally defined in AWS SSO.
