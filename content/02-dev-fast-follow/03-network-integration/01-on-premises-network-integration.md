## Requirements

In many cases, organizations require that applications and workloads hosted in AWS can connect to workloads and shared services hosted on-premises and vice versa.  

* Cloud client access to defined non-prod application and data services.
* On-premises access to newly deployed cloud hosted development, pre-production test, prod workloads and services.
* Cloud client access to on-premises source code management access.
* Hybrid DNS resolution:
  * On-premises clients resolve custom FQDNs for cloud hosted services.
  * Cloud clients resolve customer FQDNs on on-premises services.
  
* Security
  * Protect against external attack vectors from the Internet.
  * Protect against internal data loss/exfiltration to the Internet.
  * Ensure that only appropriate cloud networks and cloud hosted services can have connectivity to appropriate internal networks and services and vice vesa.
  
* Non-overlapping allocation of IP address ranges for use by cloud environments.

## Solution Options and Resources

Typically, as an initial means to quickly establish this connectivity, one pr more VPN connections are established using existing on-premises network appliances and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN capability in conjunction with AWS Transit Gateway.  AWS Transit Gateway centralizes and simplifies sharing on-premises to AWS network integration across multiple VPCs.

Introduction of a new Network AWS account is a common approach in which shared network resources such as the AWS Transit Gateway configuration can be isolated and managed separately from team oriented AWS accounts and the other shared accounts.

Longer term, as your on-premises to AWS network connectivity needs expand, you will typically transition from using site-to-site VPN connections to AWS Direct Connect.  When using AWS Transit Gateway as the termination point for VPN and AWS Direct Connect connections, a migration from using VPN to AWS Direct Connect has no impact on the VPCs behind the Transit Gateway.

If you didnâ€™t use a non-overlapping range from the start, you will need to either replace your initial set of development VPCs with VPCs that use non-overlapping IP addresses or implement Network Address Translation (NAT).

## 1. Create a Customer Gateway in your **`Network`** account

{{% notice info %}}
**Network Account:** You will begin by making changes in the **`Network`** account you setup earlier.  You will be using the development VPC setup from [Set Up Dev Network](/01-dev/02-establish-initial-foundation/05-set-up-common-dev-network.html)
{{% /notice %}}

1. As a Cloud Administrator, use your personal user to log into AWS SSO.
2. Select the **`Network`** AWS account
3. Select **`Management console`** associated with the **`AWSAdministratorAccess`** role.
4. Select the appropriate AWS region.
5. Navigate to **`VPC`** and click on **`Customer Gateways`** in the left navigation
6. Click the button **`Create Customer Gateway`**
7. Fill out the Customer Gateway form details.  Some suggested fields are below:

|Field|Recommendation|
|-----|---------------|
|**`Name`**|acme-network-on-prem-cgw-01|
|**`Routing`**|Dynamic Routing|
|**`BGP ASN`**|6500|
|**`IP Address`**|enter the value of the public IP Address of your on-premises gateway address for your VPN |
|**`Certificate ARN`**|Leave empty|
|**`Device`**|Leave empty|

{{% notice info %}}
**Customer Gateway ID:** Please note down the Customer Gateway ID for the recently created Customer Gateway.  You will use this in later steps.
{{% /notice %}}

## 2. Create a Transit Gateway in your **`Network`** account

1. While you are still in the **`VPN Console`** administration, click on **`Transit Gateways`** in the left navigation
2. Click the button **`Create Transit Gateway`**
3. Fill out the Transit Gateway form details.  Some suggested fields are below:

|Field|Recommendation|
|-----|---------------|
|**`Name tag`**|acme-network-tgw-01|
|**`Description`**|Transit Gateway in order to route traffic to/from On-Prem network as well as within VPCs |

{{% notice info %}}
**Transit Gateway ID:** Please note down the Transit Gateway ID for the recently created Transit Gateway.  You will use this in later steps.
{{% /notice %}}

## 3. Create a **`VPN`** Transit Gateway Attachment in your **`Network`** account

1. While you are still in the **`VPN Console`** administration, click on **`Transit Gateway Attachments`** in the left navigation
2. Click the button **`Create Transit Gateway Attachment`**
3. Fill out the Transit Gateway Attachment form details.  Some suggested fields are below:

|Field|Recommendation|
|-----|---------------|
|**`Transit Gateway ID`**|Select value from dropdown that matched the ID of the Transit Gateway you just created.|
|**`Attachment Type`**|VPN|
|**`Customer Gateway`**|Existing|
|**`Customer Gateway ID`**|Select value from dropdown that matched the ID of the Customer Gateway you just created.|
|**`Routing options`**|Dynamic (requires BGP)|

{{% notice info %}}
**Transit Gateway Attachment Name:** Once created, it is recommended to provide a name to the Transit Gateway Attachment.  To do this, select the checkbox of the row for the attachment you just created.  Click the **`pencil`** icon under the **`Name`** column.  Enter a name (i.e. acme-routing-tgw-vpn-01).
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice info %}}
**VPN:** As a result of the VPN attachment being provisioned, you will notice that a Site-to-Site VPN Connection resource has been created for the attachment.
{{% /notice %}}

## 4. Configure your Site-to-Site **`VPN`** connection

1. While you are still in the **`VPN Console`** administration, click on **`Site-to-Site VPN Connections`** in the left navigation
2. Select the VPN just created in the list of VPN connections
3. Click on the **`Actions`** button and select **`Modify VPN Connection`**
4. Edit the name for your VPN connection.  (Suggestion: acme-routing-vpn-onprem-01)
5. Download the VPN configuration information by clicking **` Download Configuration`**
6. Use the configuration to configure you on-premises VPN gateway.

{{% notice info %}}
**VPN Configuration:** Select your Vendor, Platform, and Software from the dropdowns.  If you specific vendor is not available, select **`Generic`**.  As a best practice, AWS provides your configuration file with a primary and secondary VPN configuration.  This allows for redundancy of your VPN connection.
{{% /notice %}}

Once your VPN is configured on-premises, navigate back to the Site-to-Site VPN Connections within the VPC console.  Select the row of your VPN connection.  At the botton of the page, select the **`Tunnel Details`** tab.  Verify that the Status has changed from "DOWN" to "UP" (this may take a few minutes).


### Trouble shooting tips:
- Ensure that routing tables on AWS and router configurations (on-premises) are setup to allow communication.
- Ensure VPC route tables associated with subnets route traffic destined for the other site to the local VPN gateway instance.
- If using Transit Gateway on the remote site, ensure that VPC route tables are configured to route traffic destined for the other site to the Transit Gateway. (Although the built-in BGP support in this stack will ensure that both the local VPN gateway's route information and the remote Transit Gateway's route table will be automatically configuired, you still need to ensure that the VPC route tables in both sites are properly configured).

## 5. Create a Transit Gateway Attachment to connect to your VPC

1. While you are still in the **`VPN Console`** administration, click on **`Transit Gateway Attachments`** in the left navigation
2. Click the button **`Create Transit Gateway Attachment`**

|**`Target`**|Select value from dropdown that matched the ID of the Transit Gateway you just created.|

{{% notice info %}}
**On-premises VPN Routes:** You will need to make similar types of changes to the routing rules with your on-premises infrastructure in order to route to the reserved CIDR ranges you have allocated for your AWS environment(s).

{{% notice info %}}
**Transit Gateway Attachment - Pending Acceptance:** If your account is not setup as **`Auto accept shared attachments: enable`**, after you create the Transit Gateway Attachment, the status will show as **`pending acceptance`**.  You will need to log into your **`Network`** account and accept the Transit Gateway Attachment by selecting it in the VPC console and going to **`Actions|Accept`**.  Once this is done, the VPC will show up under the **`Transit Gateway Route Table - Associations`**.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice info %}}
**Transit Gateway Route Tables - Propagations:** If your Transit Gateway is configured for **`Default propagation route table: enable`**.  If not, you will need to log into your **`Network`** account, navigate to the **`Transit Gateway Route Tables`**, select your route table, go to the **`Propagations`** tab, and create a new propagation to the VPC in your attachment account.
